but by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and i couldn’t stand it. i was all over welts.  he got to going away so much, too, and locking me in.  once he locked me in and was gone three days.  it was dreadful lonesome.  i judged he had got drownded, and i wasn’t ever going to get out any more.  i was scared.  i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there.  i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but i couldn’t find no way.  there warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through.  i couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.  the door was thick, solid oak slabs.  pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, i was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.  but this time i found something at last; i found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. i greased it up and went to work.  there was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out.  i got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big enough to let me through.  well, it was a good long job, but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap’s gun in the woods.  i got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.  pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self.  he said he was down town, and everything was going wrong.  his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and judge thatcher knowed how to do it. and he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  this shook me up considerable, because i didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.but by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and i couldn’t stand it. i was all over welts.  he got to going away so much, too, and locking me in.  once he locked me in and was gone three days.  it was dreadful lonesome.  i judged he had got drownded, and i wasn’t ever going to get out any more.  i was scared.  i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there.  i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but i couldn’t find no way.  there warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through.  i couldn’t get up the chimbly;

it was too narrow.  the door was thick, solid oak slabs.  pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, i was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.  but this time i found something at last; i found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. i greased it up and went to work.  there was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out.  i got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big enough to let me through.  well, it was a good long job, but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap’s gun in the woods.  i got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.  pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self.  he said he was down town, and everything was going wrong.  his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and judge thatcher knowed how to do it. and he said people allowed there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  this shook me up considerable, because i didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.but by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and i couldn’t stand it. i was all over welts.  he got to going away so much, too, and locking me in.  once he locked me in and was gone three days.  it was dreadful lonesome.  i judged he had got drownded, and i wasn’t ever going to get out any more.  i was scared.  i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there.  i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but i couldn’t find no way.  there warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through.  i couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.  the door was thick, solid oak slabs.  pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times;
